/**
 * This enum is used to specify the result of a Bet and includes the four values UNDETERMINED,
 * PLAYER_LOSS, DRAW, PLAYER_WIN. The first of these values should be the default results for
 * all bets until the results are determined by calling {@link model.bet.Bet#finaliseBet(model.card.Hand)}
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Hint: </b> You may find it useful to override methods in the enum and/or
 * on each of the value.
 * 
 * <p><b>Hint: </b>Be sure to follow naming conventions for your enum values
 * 
 * <p><b>Note: </b> The {@link BetResult#valueOf(String)} and {@link BetResult#values()} methods are 
 * provided by the API - you do not need to write or override them yourself.
